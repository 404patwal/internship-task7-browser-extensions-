# Internship Task 7 — Identifying and Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Steps Taken
1. Opened Chrome’s extension manager (`chrome://extensions/`).
2. Reviewed the list of installed extensions.
3. Found that no extensions were installed.
4. Since no suspicious or unused extensions were present, no removal was necessary.

## Learning

- Always install extensions only from trusted developers.
- Regularly review installed extensions to keep the browser secure.

## Outcome
- Confirmed browser had no extensions installed.
- Task demonstrates awareness of extension security.
